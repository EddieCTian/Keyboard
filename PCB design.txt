1. draw schematic (circuit diagram)

2. label all the nodes and eda (altium/eagle) knows they are connected (net
labels) and that makes a net. 

3. make spreadsheet for BoM 

4. make a footprint (representation of a part on pcb) which is a combination
of holes, pads (of copper) and solder mask (ink on pcb) 

4.1 . for footprints and schematic symbols, download/make yourself. (better to
make yourself so you don't get wrecked by similar parts)

5. match parts to footprint in eda and compile. 

6. make a layout for parts-footprints are imported and lines show what are
connected according to nets, then arrange everything and put in traces. (Try
not to use auto-routing tools)

7. then order and solder (bringing up the pcb) and test


stuff to google:
2 layer pcb/multilayer pcb

via- hole through board w copper around the hole (not for soldering, just for
tunneling through board)

ground/power planes

trace width-depending on amperage and other stuff

keep analog and digital signals separate
