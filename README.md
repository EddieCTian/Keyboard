# Keyboard

Repository for .sch, .brd, and qmk configuration files for a keyboard I tried to desgin

## Version 1

Doesn't work due to a clock frequency mismatch between VCC (3.3V) and the required voltage for that clock (5V). As a result, it cannot connect to USB and also has layout issues. 

## Version 2

Fixed problems in version 1, but has yet to be checked or sent to a manufacturer to fabricate. 

Stopped working on this project since it got prohibitively expensive to purchase parts.

Maybe in the future it will become a working keyboard.
